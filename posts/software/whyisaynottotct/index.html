        <h1>Why I say not to Timed Coding Test</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content__body">
        <p>For a good explanation and also good post about <em>timed coding test</em>, (TCT) you can check this <a href="https://torazaburo.medium.com/the-tyranny-of-the-timed-coding-interview-6d40a54c0733">link</a></p>
<p>A TCT could check your ability to solve some problems, algorithms most of them, in a timely manner. It could give you some idea of how good you are as problem solving person. But is that enough? or even good measure of how &ldquo;good&rdquo; your are?</p>
<p>Solving TCTs could be trained. With a couple of weeks of intensive work, you could do it decently, which doesn&rsquo;t play in favor of the TCTs to discriminate good from bad developers. üò≥</p>
<p>Moreover&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>What should someone expect from a Senior Software Engineer?</li>
</ul>
<p>A senior should be able to bring quality and clean code. Code that can evolve, that should be easy to maintain and should be easy to read. We should be able to take a project from the beginning and deliver a production ready one. We should be able to solve the biggest problem of the company or our client. A senior should even help the junior to learn and grow.</p>
<p>Now read both paragraphs and tell me what do they have in common? Nothing? Yes, you are right.</p>
<p>The reason why I don&rsquo;t take TCTs is because <em>I cannot bring what makes me a senior</em>. The code that I will write in a couple of hours, with the pressure of the time, will be even surpassed, in quality, by the worst of the juniors out there üòÇ &hellip; also the ability to write clean code play against me very badly. When I solve a problem, even algos, I always think if the code is clean. Many years already doing it makes it impossible for me to disconnect of that behavior.</p>
<p>TCTs are fun, I also competed in the past in some of those very well known pages. I also, some day, will participate in <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam">Code Jam</a> or any similar but, please don&rsquo;t try to valuate me with one, because you know what will be my answer.</p>
