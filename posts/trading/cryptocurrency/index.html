        <p>TL;DR: Cryptos came to stay, but what is insane is their valuation. As an example, when Bitcoin reached $1000 for the first time back in the day, I tweeted something like: “$1000? is the people crazy?”</p>
<h2 id="cryptos-came-to-stay">Cryptos came to stay?</h2>
<p>Cryptos are not an scam like many argue. Let me tell you a bit of technology history that will put this in perspective. Starting back in the 80s, some developers tried to create the first cryptocurrency -that I have constance of- I remember read about in the old computer magazines. Since then, many people tried and develop versions but all of the failed. I am not talking about just of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/were-there-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin/">one or two nerd</a>. Bitcoin itself would be just another point of the history if it wasn’t by the idea of using Blockchain. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> was a freaking revolution and the solution for all the problems that others have had before. Years of trying and many projects after, a real and tangible solution arrived.</p>
<p>The cryptos are not only the currencies. I know many financial professional, well intentioned, but with limited technology knowledge only see the currencies. But thinking that way is like they would say that an iceberg only have the ice that you see. The cryptos has complete ecosystems that deserve a good look and understanding. Projects like <a href="https://cardano.org/">Cardano</a>, <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> or <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a>, to name just a few, if you navigate a bit in their webpages, you quickly realize that the currency references or comments are not even easy to find. The cryptos and all of their ecosystems will stay for sure, because solve many actual problems and give alternative ways of do finances and commerce that many are willing to continue.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-is-their-value">How much is their value?</h2>
<p>The valuation of the cryptos are what I don’t think makes sense, sorry but I don’t see Bitcoin at $20.000 and of course not at $64.800. Anyways, it is the market who decide that and I can be wrong though. Maybe when the ecosystem get more mature they could value that amount or more but today I don’t see it. They don’t have any backing… and don’t tell me that the fiat money are in the same situation because it is not true. The fiat has the maturity and backing of the Government which has proven a long the years that is enough -most of the time- also is the market who back the fiat, you like it or not.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-bitcoin--or-any-other--will-last">How long Bitcoin -or any other- will last?</h2>
<p>That is a interesting question. I said that the cryptos came to stay, not doubt, but which one? will be bitcoin here because is the first one and for now it has, by far, the more support? Maybe yes, maybe not. The market is sovereign and it will determine that, and not me, and not any smart analyst that know more than us that you love. For your reference, even centenary companies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers">Lehman Brothers</a> “sink the beak” …bitcoin or any particular one, is not immunized to the unforgiving market reality.</p>
